# Kwai_Fair dataset

Kwai_Fair dataset is constructed by the Information Retrieval Group of Tsinghua University (THUIR) and Kwaishou Inc., and it is for research purposes only.

This dataset is collected from a real-world short-video social platform (Kwai), composed of two parts: regular system impression logs and random exposure experiment logs.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest real-world dataset containing randomly exposed data. It can be helpful in research work on recommender systems, especially in item fairness and de-biasing areas.
